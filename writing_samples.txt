Informative Writing:
The water cycle describes how water moves through our environment. It starts with evaporation, where water turns into vapor. Then it condenses into clouds and falls as precipitation. Finally, it collects in rivers and oceans, starting the cycle again.

Opinion Writing:
I believe students should be allowed to choose some of their classes. When we learn about topics we enjoy, we are more motivated. Giving students choices can help them discover their interests and talents.

Informative Writing:
Photosynthesis is the process plants use to make food. They take in sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose and oxygen. This process is essential for life on Earth because it provides oxygen for animals and humans to breathe.

I think schools should have more field trips. Visiting museums, science centers, or historical sites helps us learn in a fun way. Field trips make lessons come alive and give us experiences we can’t get in the classroom.


Grade 7

The human digestive system breaks down food so the body can absorb nutrients. It starts in the mouth, where food is chewed and mixed with saliva. Then it moves through the esophagus to the stomach, where acids break it down further. The small intestine absorbs nutrients, and waste exits through the large intestine.

Informative Writing:
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. It is largely driven by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, causing global temperatures to rise and leading to more extreme weather events.

Opinion Writing:
I think schools should start later in the morning. Teenagers need more sleep to stay healthy and focused. Early start times can lead to sleep deprivation, which affects learning and mood. A later start would help students perform better and feel more rested.


Grade 9

Narrative Writing:
I remember the first time I performed in front of an audience. It was our school’s talent show, and I played the piano. My hands were shaking, and I almost forgot the notes.

High school students should be required to complete community service hours. Volunteering helps students develop empathy, leadership, and a sense of civic duty. It also connects them to their communities and can inspire future career paths.


Grade 11

These tasks include speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI is used in many industries, from healthcare to finance, and continues to evolve rapidly.

Opinion Writing:
Standardized testing should not be the primary measure of student success. These tests often fail to capture creativity, critical thinking, and individual learning styles. Schools should use a variety of assessments to evaluate student growth and potential.


Grade 12
========

Narrative Writing:
As I prepare to graduate, I reflect on how much I’ve grown. Freshman year, I was shy and unsure of myself. Over the years, I joined clubs, made friends, and challenged myself academically. Senior year has been bittersweet, but I feel ready for the next chapter. High school taught me resilience, and I’m excited for the future.

Informative Writing:
The electoral college is a system used in the United States to elect the president. Each state has a certain number of electors based on its population. When citizens vote, they are actually voting for electors who pledge to support a candidate. This system has been debated for its fairness and effectiveness.

Opinion Writing:
College should be more affordable for all students. Higher education opens doors to better opportunities, but rising tuition costs make it inaccessible for many. Governments and institutions should work together to reduce costs and provide more financial aid.
