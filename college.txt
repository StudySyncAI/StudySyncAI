Poor Writing Samples
Narrative:
Jake hates his job. Boss is mean. Coworkers annoy him. One day he quits. Feels free. Goes traveling. Finds himself. Happy ending.

Informative:
Climate change: Earth getting hotter. Ice melting. Storms worse. Humans cause it. Need to stop pollution. Future bad if we don’t act.

Opinion/Persuasive:
School uniforms bad. Kids should pick own clothes. Uniforms boring. Expensive too. Let students be creative. Freedom matters.

Average Writing Samples
Narrative:
The hospital room was too bright. Machines beeped. Mom squeezed my hand, her skin papery. I pretended not to see the fear in her eyes. The doctor walked in, clipboard in hand. One sentence changed everything: “We need to talk about treatment options.”

Informative:
The Industrial Revolution (1760-1840) transitioned economies from farming to factories. Steam engines, textiles, and urbanization defined the era. Workers faced long hours and child labor, but living standards eventually rose. It laid groundwork for modern capitalism.

Opinion/Persuasive:
Public libraries are vital but underfunded. They offer free books, internet, and community programs, especially for low-income families. Yet budgets keep shrinking. Cities must invest more—libraries combat inequality and foster lifelong learning.

Strong Writing Samples
Narrative:
The old typewriter weighed heavy in my lap, its keys yellowed with cigarette smoke and time. I pressed one; it stuck. Grandma used to write her novels on this, her fingers flying between martini sips. Now it’s mine, along with her unfinished last chapter—and the silence she left instead of goodbye.

Informative:
Neuroscience reveals that memory is reconstructive, not static. Each recall alters the memory itself, embedding new biases. Eyewitness testimony, once gold-standard evidence, is now known to be highly malleable. This has profound implications for criminal justice, where wrongful convictions often hinge on flawed human recollection.

Opinion/Persuasive:
The “gig economy” commodifies flexibility, masking precarious labor as empowerment. Apps like Uber and TaskRabbit shift risk from corporations to workers, who lack benefits, job security, or collective bargaining power. Policymakers must redefine employment laws to address this erosion of worker rights in the digital age.

The Myth of Meritocracy in Higher Education
Elite universities tout meritocracy while perpetuating systemic inequity. Legacy admissions, donor influence, and extracurricular advantages (e.g., costly internships, private tutors) disproportionately benefit the affluent. Meanwhile, low-income students—even those with comparable academic merit—face barriers like application fees, SAT prep costs, and opaque admissions criteria. This veneer of fairness obscures a reality where privilege begets privilege, entrenching class stratification under the guise of “equal opportunity.” Reforming these systems requires not just need-blind admissions, but radical transparency in selection processes and redistribution of resources to level the playing field.
